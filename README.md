# EduTutor AI
Personalized Learning with Generative AI and LMS Integration  


## 📌 Project Overview  
EduTutor AI is an educational assistant built as part of the **Naan Mudhalvan Project**.  
It uses **IBM Granite AI models** in **Google Colab** with a **Gradio interface** to help students:  
- Get clear **concept explanations**  
- Practice with **auto-generated quizzes**  

The goal is to show how generative AI can support **personalized learning** and integrate with simple Learning Management System (LMS) features.  


## 🚀 Features  
- **Concept Explanation**: Type any concept (e.g., Photosynthesis) → get a detailed explanation with examples.  
- **Quiz Generator**: Enter a topic (e.g., Newton’s Laws) → generates 5 questions (MCQ, True/False, short answer) with an **Answers section**.  
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built using Gradio in Colab, no extra setup required.  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **IBM Granite 3.2 Model**  
- **Hugging Face Transformers**  
- **Google Colab**  
- **Gradio**
